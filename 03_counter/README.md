## Virtual DOM, Fibre, and Reconciliation: Keeping Your Web App Smooth

Imagine your web app as a restaurant menu. When you change an item's price, you don't reprint the entire menu, right? You just update the specific item. That's the idea behind **Virtual DOM, Fibre, and Reconciliation** in libraries like React.

**Virtual DOM:** Think of it as a draft copy of the real menu (the actual DOM on your screen). When you update data in your app (like changing an item's price), it first reflects in the virtual DOM.

**Fibre:** This is the chef in our analogy. It efficiently compares the draft menu (virtual DOM) with the real menu (actual DOM) and identifies only the changes that need to be made.

**Reconciliation:** This is the final step, where the chef updates the real menu with the minimum necessary changes. This avoids unnecessary re-renders and keeps your app feeling fast and responsive.

**Real-world example:**

Imagine you have a shopping cart app. When you add an item, the virtual DOM updates, and Fibre compares it with the actual DOM. Instead of redrawing the entire cart, it only updates the specific item and its quantity. This makes the update smooth and avoids lag.

**Benefits:**

* **Faster performance:** Less DOM manipulation means smoother interactions.
* **Better responsiveness:** Changes feel instant, even with complex apps.
* **Easier development:** Focus on data and logic, not DOM manipulation.

**Remember:** This is a simplified explanation, but it captures the essence of these concepts. If you're interested in learning more, feel free to ask specific questions!


# React fiber
The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
